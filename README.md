# Titanic-Survival-Kaggle-
Logistic Regression model for the famous Titanic problem of Kaggle

Since it is a classification problem and probability of survival is the main issue, logistic regression can be a very efficient model in such cases since it uses sigmoid function and varies between 0 and 1. And since ScikitLearn default value is 0.5 it shows pretty precise solutions. 


Datasets used are train.csv and test.csv

sub.csv is the resultant solution file we will get after running the code.

The main jupyter notebook code is named t.ipynb.
